### Hi, I'm `Nat(e|han|haniel)` 👋🏻, but mostly nate

I like to:
 - 🎵 listen to music
 - 🛀🏻 this is supposed to be relaxing, I don't just like bathing
 - 🚵🏻‍♀️ ride my bike
 - 🧮 do mathy things
 - 👩🏼‍💻 get _the_ computer to do things for me (this looks more like me than the "man technologist")

I like thinking about education, privacy, and what to do with my life. Still working on all of those, but I'm trying.

I'm now a PhD student at the University of Waterloo in the applied math department working with [Joel Wallman](https://services.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/people/profile/jwallman/).
