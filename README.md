### it's nate

I like to:
 - 🧮 do mathy things
 - 👩🏼‍💻 get computers to do things for me
 - 🎵 listen to music
 - 🛀🏻 this is supposed to be relaxing, I don't just like bathing
 - 🚵🏻‍♀️ ride my bike

I like thinking about quantum things, education, privacy, and what to do with my life. Still working on all of those, but it's a process... right?

When I'm not doing those things, I work as a "member of technical staff" at [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund).

my pronouns are he/they
