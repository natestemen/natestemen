### Hi, I'm `Nat(e|han|haniel)` 👋🏻, but mostly nate

<!-- Here's a pic of me going real real fast. One might say I'm zooming.

I like to:
 - 🎵 listen to music
 - 🛀🏻 this is supposed to be relaxing, I don't just like bathing
 - 🚵🏻‍♀️ riding my bike
 - 🧮 math
 - 👩🏼‍💻 this looks more like me than the "man technologist"

I like thinking about education, privacy, and what to do with my life. Still working on all of those, but I'm trying.

I currently work at [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) as a \~s o f t\~ware dev, but I will be going to the University of Waterloo starting fall 2020 to start a PhD in quantum information. We'll see if that brings me closer to the things I wanna do 😛.
