### it's nate

I like to:
 - 🧮 do mathy things
 - 👩🏼‍💻 get computers to do things for me
 - 🎵 listen to music
 - 🛀🏻 this is supposed to be relaxing, I don't just like bathing
 - 🚵🏻‍♀️ ride my bike

I like thinking about quantum things, education, privacy, and what to do with my life. Still working on all of those, but it's a process... right?

Oh, I'm also PhD student at the University of Waterloo in the applied math department and I work part time as a content development specialist for [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com).
