### it's nate

I like to:
 - 🧮 do mathy things
 - 👩🏼‍💻 get computers to do things for me
 - 🎵 listen to music
 - 🛀🏻 this is supposed to be relaxing, I don't just like bathing
 - 🚵🏻‍♀️ ride my bike

I like thinking about making quantum computing a reality for everyone, education/pedagogy, and privacy.

For work, you'll find me as a "member of technical staff" at [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund).

my pronouns are he/they
